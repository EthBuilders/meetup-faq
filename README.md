## Learning

### How can I learn more about blockchain?

The [Explain Like I'm Five series has a Bitcoin edition](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/explain-bitcoin-like-im-five-73b4257ac833/),
and it's a good read for non-technical audiences. If you'd
like the high-level ideas without necessarily becoming a
programmer, start here.

The ["Halloween Paper"](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
by Satoshi Nakomoto is a short and sweet
read of the coin that launched a thousand movements. It uses
math symbols and is written like an academic paper, but is
densely packed full of powerful ideas that we are still
exploring today.

If you like learning by talking to real people, coming to a
meetup or a hackathon is the best way to learn. Depending on
your city, here are some great meetups we know about.

### How can I get started with blockchain development?

Coming to these meetups and asking / answering questions is a good first step.

Depending on which blockchain you are interested in developing for, there are
different resources. If you like working through a book, the best online books
are below, although they are each slightly dated. They are still correct and
will teach you the fundamentals, but they won't contain the latest developments
for each chain.

For Bitcoin, and blockchains in general, the [Master Bitcoin](https://bitcoinbook.info/)
book is a great place to start. If you want to
understand the nuts-and-bolts of transactions, what actual bytes are being
sent over the network for the Bitcoin protocol, and step-by-step examples
you can try on the command-line, this is the book for you.
Most blockchains are forks of the Bitcoin source code, and all blockchains use
the basic ideas pioneered from Bitcoin.

For Ethereum, the [Homestead Guide](https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
is the first and still best comprehensive documentation.
It's how I first learned to develop for Ethereum in 2015, working through the
Democracy example for online voting.

If you'd like to a contribute to an open source project (e.g. for Hacktoberfest),
we'd love to have your help on the Democracy.js framework
